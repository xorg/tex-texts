Here I'll throw some Tex-Projects in from time to time.

Most of them will be written with the ConTeXt macro-package, maybe I'll try LaTeX when I have enough time.
My first project will be a small repetition talk about compound interest. Just one sheet and very small, but it's a start. More to come.
